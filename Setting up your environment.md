<h1>Let's begin by creating our resource group!</h1>

    Go to portal.azure.com. You will have a wide variety of options to click on, but go ahead and click on 'Resource Groups'.

    Let's name it 'RG-Lab-1' and put it in our region of choice. I chose (US) West US 2 because it's the closest to me.

    We can go ahead and create our resource group. There are other options that we can adjust but they are not important to our lab.

    Next, we will be using two virtual machines. One will be running Windows 10 and the other will be using a Linux Server (Ubuntu).
