# Common Network Traffic

- Now that we have Wireshark set up, let's examine what is actually happening in the network between VM1 and VM2!
- Go ahead and grab VM2's private IP address. You can locate it under VM2's 'Networking' section. It may be different from mine. Go ahead and copy it to your clipboard.

- Let's [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) VM2's private IP address. the ping command uses [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) packets to basically show you the round-trip time to and from a source and destination. The source here being VM1 and the destination being VM2.
- Open up Windows Powershell by searching 'Powershell' in the start menu. Powershell is similar to command prompt but with much more functionality and features designed for Windows.
- Type into Powershell:

      Ping (VM2's Private Address)

- In the picture above, we sent and received 4 packets with 0% loss. Our connection is working great! Take note that our TTL=64. TTL refers to how many network hops a packet can traverse rather than the actual lifespan in milli-seconds.
- Let's see what happens when we ping Google.com. Type into Powershell.


            Ping Google.com

- Look at Powershell's output. Notice how it doesn't say, "Reply from Google.com"? This is because of [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). DNS translates the website names to IP addresses so that computers can read them!
- Also note, not all of Google.com's IP addresses are the same. (Put explanation here)

Now let's block ICMP traffic in VM2's network security group(firewall) and see what happens when we try to ping VM2 from VM1.k

ICMP is now blocked.
