# Common Network Traffic

- Now that we have Wireshark set up, let's examine what is actually happening in the network between VM1 and VM2!
- Go ahead and grab VM2's private IP address. You can locate it under VM2's 'Networking' section. It may be different from mine. Go ahead and copy it to your clipboard.

- Let's [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) VM2's private IP address. the ping command uses [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) packets to basically show you the round-trip time to and from a source and destination. The source here being VM1 and the destination being VM2.
- Open up Windows Powershell by searching 'Powershell' in the start menu. Powershell is similar to command prompt but with much more functionality and features designed for Windows.
- Type into Powershell:
