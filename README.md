  This project will show you how to analyze various network traffic using Wirehark inside a Microsoft Azure environment!

# Prerequisites: 

 + To start, you will need a Microsoft Azure account. Microsoft offers $200 worth of free Azure credits to brand new users but if you have already used Azure before, it will cost a fee to use Azure along with a non-prepaid credit card for billing.  
However, it should be relatively inexpensive due to the small scope of this project. The project should less than 5 hours to complete.

        ⚠️ After you are finished using your Azure resources, DON'T FORGET TO DELETE THEM! ⚠️

        ⚠️ You WILL incure more on your Azure billing if you forget and leave them running! ⚠️

 + You will also need Remote Desktop Connection, which is availabe to Windows computers. For Mac users, there should be a Microsoft Remote Desktop app on Apple's App Store.
