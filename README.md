# Wireshark In Azure
This project will show you how to analyze various network traffic using Wirehark inside a Microsoft Azure enviornment!

You will need a Microsoft Azure account to start. Microsoft offers $200 worth of free Azure credits to brand new users but if you have already used Azure before, it will cost a fee to use Azure. However, it is relatively small due to the small scope of this project. Also it depends on how many resources you would like to use as well.

⚠️ After you are finished using your Azure resources, DON'T FORGET TO DELETE THEM! ⚠️

⚠️ You WILL incure more on your Azure billing if you forget and leave them running! ⚠️
