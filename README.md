# Wireshark In Azure
  This project will show you how to analyze various network traffic using Wirehark inside a Microsoft Azure enviornment!

  To start, you will need a Microsoft Azure account. Microsoft offers $200 worth of free Azure credits to brand new users but if you have already used Azure before, it will cost a fee to use Azure along with a non-prepaid credit card for billing.  

  However, it is relatively small fee due to the small scope of this project. The project should less than 5 hours to complete.

⚠️ After you are finished using your Azure resources, DON'T FORGET TO DELETE THEM! ⚠️

⚠️ You WILL incure more on your Azure billing if you forget and leave them running! ⚠️
