# The Azure services we'll be using:
- [Resource Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)
- [Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/overview)
- [Virtual Networks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)

### Let's begin by creating our resources!

- Go to portal.azure.com. There are a wide variety of options to click on, but go ahead and click on 'Resource Groups'.

</p>

- Let's name it 'RG-Lab-1' and put it in our region of choice. I chose (US) West US 2 because it's the closest to me.

</p>

- We can go ahead and create our resource group. There are other options that can adjusted but they are not important to our lab.
- Next, we will create two virtual machines. One will be running Windows 10 and the other will be using a Linux Server (Ubuntu). We can go to the virtual machines by typing 'Virtual Machines' into the search bar or by clicking on the 'Virtual Machines' tab on the homepage. Now, let's make our Windows 10 VM.
- It should be under our Azure subscription and inside the Resource Group we made earlier. Put it inside the Resource Group if it isn't already. Name it 'VM1' and put it inside the same region as the Resource Group. For the image, use Windows 10 (22H2). For the size, the smallest should work fine for this lab. Then, let's give ourselves a username and password for this virtual machine.
    
         ‼️Write it down! We will need the username and password later to Remote Desktop into VM1!‼️

</p>

- Click and confirm the licensing at the bottom of the page.
- Now go from the 'Basics' tab and skip to the 'Networking' tab. You will see some choices for how the virtual machine handles networking. Hover to 'Virtual Network' and click 'Create new'. Create a vnet and name it 'RG-Lab-1-vnet' with default settings. We will be using this vnet for both of the virtual machines.

</p>

- After that, the virtual machine is now ready to be deployed! Click create and allow it to process.
- In the meantime, we can create our Linux server virtual machine. Create another virtual machine and follow the same processes but this time name it 'VM2'and image it with 'Ubuntu Server 20.04'.

</p>

- Rather than have the 'Authentication type' be set to SSH public key, let's change it to password. It will prompt for a username and password just like VM1. Write this one down as well! We'll need it later to SSH into VM2!

</p>

- Just like VM1, set the virtual network of the Ubuntu server to RG-Lab-1-vnet. We want both VM's on the same virtual network.

</p>

- We now have both virtual machines ready for the lab to use! Let's connect to the Windows 10 VM using Remote Desktop Connection. 
- First, go to VM1 under 'Virtual Machines' and find it's public IP address. Then, open up Remote Desktop by searching for Remote Desktop in the start menu search bar. Paste VM1's public IP address into RDP. It will now prompt you for the username and password we set earlier.

</p>

- The virtual machine will now ask us how we'd like to set up our new Windows 10 operating system. We can just ignore this and go straight to the new operating system. 
- Our next step is getting Wireshark set up on VM1. Let's open up Microsoft Edge and download Wireshark from it's official website.

<p>

</p>

- Download the Windows x64 installer. Click yes to all until Wireshark is finished installing. We can close Microsoft Edge now.

</p>

- Wireshark should look something like this. You might notice that a bunch of network traffic is happening despite not having anything else open. This is because we have RDP traffic flowing from VM1 to your physical computer!
- Congrats! We now have our environment set up for this lab.
